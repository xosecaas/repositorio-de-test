# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This repository is a starter project for "Ingenier√≠a de Software" coursework. It currently contains minimal structure and documentation. The main files are:
- `README.md`: Project description and installation instructions
- `LICENSE`: License information

## Architecture & Structure
- No source code or subdirectories are present yet. The project is expected to grow as coursework progresses.
- No build, test, or automation scripts are present.
- No external dependencies or integrations are currently defined.

## Developer Workflows
- **Installation**: As per `README.md`, simply download the repository. No further setup is required at this stage.
- **Image Reference**: The README includes a project image for reference.

## Conventions & Patterns
- Documentation is in Spanish.
- No coding conventions, file naming patterns, or architectural decisions are established yet.
- No custom scripts or commands are present.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- If adding code, follow standard conventions for the language chosen by the user.
- If expanding the project, update the README and this instructions file to reflect new workflows, dependencies, or conventions.
- Prefer concise, Spanish-language documentation to match existing content.
- Reference key files (`README.md`, `LICENSE`) when describing project structure or changes.

## Example Actions
- When adding a new source file, update the README with usage or installation notes.
- If introducing dependencies, document installation steps in the README and this file.
- If creating new workflows (build, test, etc.), describe them here for future agents.
